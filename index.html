                    <h1>KiwiLink: UW study buddy finder - friend your way to the top!</h1>
                    <p>Do you attend the University of Washington (UW)? Have you ever felt lonely or lost while studying at this huge university?</p>

                    <p>Picture this: you walk into Kane Hall for your very first lecture and there are literally hundreds of students around you. You start to feel anxious about everything. “How will I find a friend to study with? There are so many people in this lecture hall and I’m so overwhelmed… I’ve always been a relatively social person, but UW is just so massive… Where do I even start?”</p>    
                        
                    <p>Introducing KiwiLink - the ultimate study buddy finder app FOR UW students BY UW students! </p>    
                        
                    <p>As a KiwiLink user, you will be introduced to dozens and dozens of students who share classes or majors with you. You will be able to read about their personalities, their classes, and their majors! Just like that, you will be able to befriend lots of study buddies. </p>    
                        
                    <p>You swipe to the right to add someone as a friend, that person accepts the friend request, and BOOM - it’s time for you to start talking to this new study buddy about computer science or about psychology or about pre-med or whatever!</p>    
                        
                    <p>KiwiLink is truly a tool for enhancing social academics at the UW. Now, more than ever, we are in need of a study buddy tool that caters towards solving anti-social-academics at the UW. After all, most UW students will be attending their UW classes by using Zoom and other online tools. As a result, we see that many UW students are having trouble maintaining good grades and maintaining good, academic-friendships. Thankfully, KiwiLink is built to address ALL of these pressing issues. </p>    
                        
                    <p>Say goodbye to being lonely! Say goodbye to boring studying! Say goodbye to the looming threat of a poor GPA!</p>    
                        
                    <p>Say hello to KiwiLink: the ultimate UW study buddy finder!</p>
