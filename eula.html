                        6. Reporting Inappropriate Behavior

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        - While using KiwiLink, you may encounter users that are exhibiting toxic and inappropriate behaviors. For example, there is a chance that a toxic user could post a sexually explicit profile picture, and there is a chance that a toxic user could post a racially insensitive bio, or something of that nature. If you encounter inappropriate content, please use KiwiLink’s report function. If (while scrolling through the “Explore” or “For You” pages) you find that there is a user who is clearly breaching the KiwiLink community guidelines, you can report that user’s profile card using KiwiLink’s report feature. You can also report a user if they send you a message that breaches community guidelines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - If you report a user for breaching community guidelines, KiwiLink will investigate the issue within 24 hours. If KiwiLink finds that the reported user has clearly breached KiwiLink’s community guidelines and/or terms of use, KiwiLink will terminate the reported user’s account. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Beyond reporting a user, you can also block a user. If a user is harassing you or sending you offensive content or pictures, you can report that user, and you can also proceed by blocking that user. From that point on, the blocked user will no longer be able to message you or view your profile card. If you accidentally block a user, you can then unblock that user.
